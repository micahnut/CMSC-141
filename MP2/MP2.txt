MP2 - Smiling, Regular?
AS IN MP 1, you may work with collaborators following the same rules of collaboration.

Given a regular expression, determine whether certain strings are generated by it.

The input file consists of a number of lines. The first line contains the number of test cases.  The following lines contain the test cases. Each test case consists of the regular expression, followed by a number representing the number of strings that need to be verified or tested (whether the regular expression generates the string (yes) or not (no) ). What follows next are the actual strings to be tested.

Sample Input:

3
a*b*
3
aaabbbbbb
aaaaaa
bbbbbaaaaa
a U b
2
a
b
(ab)*(aa U bb)*
6
e
ababaabbaabbbbaa
aaaaaabbbbbbabab
abababababab
bbbbbaaaaa
bbbbbbaaaabbaabbaa

Sample Output:

yes
yes
no
yes
yes
yes
yes
no
no
yes

NOTE: For the empty string, we will use e. Also, the input file is mp3.in. The output file is <yourfamilyname>.out.
