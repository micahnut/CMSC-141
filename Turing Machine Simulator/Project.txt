Turing Machine Simulator
Make a Turing machine simulation of for the power operator, i.e. xy. Assume all inputs are positive. Represent the inputs as strings of 1. If x = 7, and y = 3, this means that you are to represent x as 1111111 and y as 111. Show the configuration of the Turing tape for every computation of the machine does. Initially, the tape should contain x and y separated by the '#'. Below is a sample initial tape configuration (the b's are blanks. You may use some other symbol if you wish):

1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	#	1	1	1	b	b	b	b	b	b	b	b
Simulate the operation of the Turing machine that computes for xy. Again, show the configuration of the tape for every computation made. You can use the cursor (blinking _ ) to show where the tape head is going or you may change the background color of the cell to show direction or the movement of the tape head.

Ask the user to enter 2 positive numbers (integers). And use these as the inputs for the tape.

Follow the same instructions for the second problem.
